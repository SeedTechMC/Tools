## üìä YouTube Subscriber Counter Instructions

To use the subscriber counter, you‚Äôll need to **invite** `API@Seed.soy` as a **Viewer** on the YouTube channel you want to monitor.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Invitations must be accepted manually, so it may take a few hours before your channel is usable.

This process is necessary because the official YouTube API no longer returns your real subscriber count.

### üîó API Endpoint

If you want to build your own counter, you can use this API endpoint to get a channel‚Äôs subscriber count:

```

Replace `CHANNEL_ID` with your channel‚Äôs ID.

### üåê Web Tool

You can also use the web tool directly:
```
http://tools.seed.soy/SubscriberCount?channel=YOUR_CHANNEL_ID&digits=DIGITS_IN_YOUR_SUBSCRIBER_COUNT
```
- Replace `YOUR_CHANNEL_ID` with your channel‚Äôs ID.
- Replace `DIGITS_IN_YOUR_SUBSCRIBER_COUNT` with the number of digits you want to display (e.g., `3` for 123, `4` for 1,234).
